# Chat-aap-in-angular-and-nodejs-with-mongodb
A simple chat application for group chat built in angular, node(used expressjs) and mongodb

Simply clone the repo and run npm install in both folders frontend and backend to download the dependencies.

run npm start for frontend and run node index.js for backend.

you must have mongodb installed on your local system or can use cloud clusters. you need to pass the url in config.json file in backend
for your database connection.

Thank you!!
